When executing an SQL query, the clauses are processed in a specific order.

FROM Clause:
The FROM clause is evaluated first.
It specifies the tables involved in the query.
If the query contains JOIN clauses, the tables are combined by merging rows before processing the FROM clause.
In statements with JOIN, the JOIN operation predates the FROM clause.


WHERE Clause:
After processing the tables specified in the FROM clause, the WHERE clause is evaluated.
The WHERE clause filters rows based on specified conditions.
Rows that don’t satisfy the conditions are discarded, reducing the data to be processed further.


GROUP BY Clause (if present):
If the query includes a GROUP BY clause, it is executed next.
Data is grouped based on common values in the specified columns.
The number of rows is reduced to the distinct values in the GROUP BY column.
This step helps calculate aggregate functions.


HAVING Clause (if present):
If the query has a GROUP BY clause, the HAVING clause is evaluated immediately after GROUP BY.
The HAVING clause filters the grouped rows based on specified conditions.
Similar to the WHERE clause, it discards rows that don’t meet the conditions.


SELECT Clause:
The SELECT clause is executed next.
It computes expressions (such as arithmetic or aggregate functions) and aliases specified in the SELECT clause.
Computation occurs on the smallest dataset after filtering and grouping operations.


DISTINCT Clause (if present):
The DISTINCT clause is executed after evaluating expressions and aliases.
It filters out duplicate rows, returning only unique rows.
